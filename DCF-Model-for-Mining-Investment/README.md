**Mining Investment Analysis (NPV-Based Decision Support)**

This project focuses on evaluating the economic feasibility of alternative gold mining production plans using discounted cash flow and NPV analysis. I was provided with Excel files containing the production profiles, cost assumptions, gold prices and other financial inputs for each scenario, which serve as the basis for the cash flow calculations and comparison.

The implementation is done in MATLAB and Simulink. The MATLAB script reads the given Excel data, constructs year-by-year cash flows for each production plan and discounts them to present value to obtain NPVs, while the Simulink model represents the project timeline and cash flow dynamics. All code and models in this repository were designed and implemented by me.
