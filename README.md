## About

This repository contains selected projects demonstrating my use of Python, MATLAB, Excel, and R for data analysis, quantitative modeling, machine learning, and visualization.

The projects focus on applying analytical and computational methods to real-world problems, with an emphasis on:
- clear problem formulation
- structured and reproducible analysis
- interpretable models and results
- well-documented code and visual outputs
